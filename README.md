# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using Ollama 3.1

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using Ollama 3.1. RAG combines information retrieval and generative modeling to provide accurate and contextually relevant responses by augmenting the generation process with external knowledge bases.

## Features
- **Knowledge-Augmented Responses**: Combines retrieved documents with generative modeling for enhanced responses.
- **Ollama 3.1 Integration**: Leverages the capabilities of Ollama 3.1 for efficient retrieval and generation.
- **Custom Knowledge Bases**: Supports integration with domain-specific datasets.
- **Evaluation Tools**: Includes metrics to evaluate the relevance and accuracy of generated responses.

## Requirements
To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook (optional for exploration)
- Required Python libraries (install via `requirements.txt`):
  ```
  ollama
  transformers
  torch
  numpy
  pandas
  ```
- Access to a knowledge base (e.g., documents or a vector database like FAISS).

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/RAG-using-Ollama-3.1.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd RAG-using-Ollama-3.1
   ```
3. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. **Set Up Knowledge Base**:
   - Prepare your documents for retrieval.
   - Index the documents using a vector database or a simple search mechanism.
2. **Run the Model**:
   - Launch the script or notebook to initialize the RAG pipeline.
   - Provide queries to retrieve relevant documents and generate responses.
3. **Evaluate**:
   - Use provided evaluation tools to assess the quality of the generated responses.

### Example
#### Input Query:
```
What are the key benefits of renewable energy?
```
#### Retrieved Documents:
- Document 1: Renewable energy reduces greenhouse gas emissions.
- Document 2: It provides a sustainable and cost-effective energy source.

#### Generated Response:
```
Renewable energy offers several benefits, including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, sustainability, and cost-effectiveness. It is a critical component in addressing climate change and ensuring energy security.
```

## How It Works
1. **Document Retrieval**:
   - Queries are used to retrieve relevant documents from the knowledge base.
2. **Augmented Generation**:
   - The retrieved documents are passed as context to the Ollama 3.1 generative model.
3. **Response Generation**:
   - The model generates a response that incorporates the retrieved information.

## Customization
You can modify the project to:
- Use different knowledge bases (e.g., Wikipedia, custom datasets).
- Replace the retrieval mechanism with advanced tools like FAISS or Elasticsearch.
- Fine-tune the generative model for domain-specific tasks.
